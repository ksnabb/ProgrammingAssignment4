The samsung data set should be loaded and exist in a directory `UCI HAR Dataset` within
the root folder. It can be downloaded from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To run the script you need to install tidyverse which is the only dependency for the script:

    install.packages("tidyverse")

Then you can run the R script run_analysis.R. 
It will output a file `result.txt` in the working directory which contains the results..
